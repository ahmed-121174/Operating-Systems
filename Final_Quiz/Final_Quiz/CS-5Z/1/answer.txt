### Q1: GPT vs MBR

- **GPT:** **GUID Partition Table**  
- **MBR:** **Master Boot Record**  

**Difference:**  
- **GPT:** Supports large drives (>2TB), unlimited partitions, and stores multiple partition tables for redundancy.  
- **MBR:** Limited to 4 primary partitions and 2TB drives, with a single partition table (less reliable).

### Q2: Type of List Maintained by Firmware  

- Firmware maintains a **Boot Device List** (or Boot Order), specifying the sequence of devices to check for bootable media.
