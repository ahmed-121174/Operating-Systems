### Q1: Process Tree for the Code

#### Code Breakdown:
1. The first `fork()` creates 1 new child process.  
2. Inside the first child process (`pid == 0`), another `fork()` is called, creating another child.  
3. A final `fork()` is called by all existing processes.

#### Process Tree:
```
          P0
       /     \
      P1      P2
     /  \    /  \
   P3   P4  P5   P6
```
- **P0**: Original process.  
- **P1, P2**: Created by the first `fork()`.  
- **P3, P4, P5, P6**: Created by subsequent `fork()` calls.

### Q2: What Happens When a Parent Dies Before Its Child?

- **Behavior:** The child process becomes an **orphan**.  
- **Outcome:** The orphaned child is adopted by the `init` process (PID 1) or a similar reaper process to ensure it is managed correctly.
