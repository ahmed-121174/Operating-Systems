- **`root` vs `/root`:**  
  - `root`: Refers to the superuser account with administrative privileges.  
  - `/root`: The home directory for the `root` user.

### Q2: What is `sudo`? How it differs from the `root` user?

- **`sudo`:** Command that allows a permitted user to execute commands with elevated (root) privileges temporarily.  

- **Scenario:** Installing software (`sudo apt install package-name`) requires administrative privileges to modify system files.  

- **Difference:**  
  - `sudo`: Executes commands as root temporarily for specific tasks, requiring authentication.  
  - `root`: A permanent superuser account with unrestricted access to the system.
